            My name is Rakeem Shelby. I am a life long learner. I am constantly trying to learn new things.
            I enjoy writing code and getting better at my craft. I look forward to sharpening my skills by taking this class.
            I'm hoping to build my experience to push my career path foward. I enjoy runnning a bit on the weekends and playing videogames.
            I currently work as a software engineer for Raytheon Technologies. The headshot of myself comes from my part-time job
            where I work as math tutor.
